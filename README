Hi! This is the repo for Omega 2016-2017 software, namely OmegaBotTeleOP and OmegaBotAuto.

Our personal code is stored in teamcode, whereas ftcrobotcontroller has vanilla code from FIRST.
Please use this as reference for future projects.

Compile and deploy using Android Studio (a guide on how to properly set up Android Studio on macOS/Windows to do actual work will be published at a later time).
Don't use javac of course.
